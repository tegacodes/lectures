# Artistic Practice is a Form of Research
Fall, 2025

---

This lecture explores how research takes place through and in artistic practices, focusing on media art at the intersection of art, design, and technology. How can art be understood as research? Where does research happen in art practice?

We will look at:  
- giving language to art as research
- artistic strategies 
- research methods used by artists
- approaches in media arts and related practices

## Poems not Demos

Unlike science, there is no "one way" of doing art (or design). 

But there are defined research methods that artists use in their process, as well as an extensive, albeit loose taxonomy of strategies artists deploy to provoke thinking, conversation, and new perspectives. As we look at work today, ask yourself: what research processes might the artist have undertaken? And what artistic strategies are at play in the final outcomes (immersion, humor, estrangement, juxtaposition, etc.)?

We will also consider scholarly literature and language around art as research.

To start, consider how computer artist Zach Lieberman, one of the founders of the School for Poetic Computation, describes his practice of poetic computing:

![](images/poems-not-demos.jpg)

When we talk about art as research, I'm not talking about quantitative work or art making that produces "solutions" to problems. I'm not talking about art as a demo of new technologies. Yes, this is what research often looks like in science, engineering, and often design, but in art, the research is embedded in or emerges through the work itself—through a story, a poem, an experience, an aesthetic, a surprising outcome, an enchanting or strange object or image. 

The outcome might appear fairly minimal (a drawing or sculpture), but art is the result of an enormous backend: engagement with history, conversations happening in theory and the field of practice, and a rigorous relationship between practice and reflection. 

Zach argues this in his essay "[Lessons for Students](https://zachlieberman.medium.com/lessons-for-students-cf1acf200ee#.cee1uz3mx)".

See Zach's [portfolio here](http://zach.li/).

We will return to some of these ideas later, but what is key here is the emphasis on art making as a form of study that requires publishing or dissemination. 

## Giving Language to Artistic Research 

![](images/hendren.png)

This is a slide from Sarah Hendren's must-watch Eyeo talk, ["Know-Nothings, Dilettantes, and Melancholy Interlopers"](https://vimeo.com/179040817?fl=pl&fe=vl), where she calls for new language that legitimizes different pathways into meaningful creative practice. 

As you might infer, there isn't one way to describe art as research. Let's examine a few terms from the literature. Note that these terms do not describe exclusive categories and many works operate as research in multiple ways.

### Practice Led vs Practice Based

My definitions below are taken from Dr Linda Candy and Ernest Edmonds from UTS in Sydney, who have [written extensively on different practice research methods.](https://www.creativityandcognition.com/practice-based-research/)

#### Practice-Led 

Research is practice-led if it "leads primarily to new understandings about the nature of practice." Practice-led work innovates new methods—for example, combining approaches from different disciplines. It produces new approaches to what art making is and what it looks like, with insights typically articulated through both the artwork AND reflective/theoretical outputs (papers, talks, documentation). Consider:

Morehshin Allahyari's [Material Speculation: ISIS (2015-2016)](https://morehshin.com/material-speculation-isis) emerges alongside her work on [*Additivism*](https://additivism.org/), which explores the activist potential of democratized 3D fabrication technologies.

![](images/ADDITIVISM_PROMO_BIG.gif)

*Critical Engineering* [(see the manifesto)](https://criticalengineering.org/) are tech-based practices that use "the exploit" as a method—publicly identifying a risk, weakness, contradiction, or way in which a technology exploits its user, then making this public through a work, performance, or experience.

Julian Oliver's [Glasshole](https://julianoliver.com/projects/glasshole/) clearly does this. 

![](images/glasshole.png) 

And Aram Bartholl's [How to Build a Fake Google Street View Car](https://arambartholl.com/how-to-build-a-fake-google-street-view-car/) is one of my all-time favorite exploits.

![](images/gcar.jpg) 

My work like [Being Radiotropic](https://tegabrain.com/Being-Radiotropic) and [Solar Protocol](https://tegabrain.com/Solar-Protocol) emerges through cycles of practice and writing around what I call [*eccentric engineering*](https://tegabrain.com/Eccentric-Engineering)—an approach I developed for my PhD thesis that uses art as a space for designing digital technologies that work in concert with environments. 

![](images/sp.png) 

#### Practice Based

Practice that adopts existing ways of working to produce new outcomes—"If the creative artifact is the basis of the contribution to knowledge, the research is practice-based." These works tend to use existing methods to produce original works of design, music, digital media, performances, and exhibitions. The work itself constitutes the research into what's possible—without necessarily producing separate theoretical papers about the findings.

### Another Way: Research *into*, *through* or *for* Art

In his well-known article ["Research in Art and Design"](https://antle.iat.sfu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frayling.pdf), cultural historian and educationalist Christopher Frayling (1993) differentiates between research *into* art, research *through* art, and research *for* art.

#### Research ***into*** Art

- Historical Research
- Aesthetic or Perceptual Research
- Research into a variety of theoretical perspectives on art and design—social, economic, political, ethical, cultural, iconographic, technical, material, structural

For example, Alan Warburton's richly researched films about the history of computational moving image making, [RGBFAQ (2020)](https://alanwarburton.co.uk/thewizardofai). RGBFAQ traces the trajectory of computer graphics from WWII to Bell Labs in the 1960s, from the visual effects studios of the 1990s to the GPU-assisted algorithms of the latest machine learning models and the emergence of synthetic datasets.

Gabriella Hirst's [Darling Darling](https://www.gabriellahirst.com/Darling-Darling**) engages with colonial Australian art history, juxtaposing a video of the painstaking restoration of a colonial painting with another video of the current degraded state of the river represented in the work.

#### Research ***through*** Art 

- Materials research
- Development research (new software or tools)
- Action research—where a research diary tells, in a step-by-step way, of a practical experiment in the studio

Kate Crawford + Trevor Paglen's [ImageNet Roulette](https://paglen.studio/2020/04/29/imagenet-roulette/). This interface acts as a portal through which we see the technology of ML differently. [Also see other works by both these artists for more examples.]

#### Research ***for*** Art 

Research for art is research where the end product is an artifact—where the thinking is embodied in the artifact, where the goal is not primarily communicable knowledge in the sense of verbal communication, but in the sense of visual, iconic, or imagistic communication.

*But all these works also straddle the previous category... and as Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg writes, that's okay—many works sit under more than one header. In other words...*

![](images/blurry.png)

Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg observes this in her 2018 PhD thesis on biodesign:

>My work encompasses all three *(approaches)*, as research and practice merge: my critical design practice informs the thesis and vice versa. My interventions in synthetic biology and its politics—reflecting the subject's live nature—developed my thinking and practice, and helped me to identify synthetic biology's proliferating meanings of better.

> Leading with practice allowed me to reflect on it afterwards, but design and theory are not separate: writing is practice too. My design projects demanded literature reviews of their own; their public exhibition, dissemination, and discussion informed my analysis and directed further reading across different disciplines, which instigated new action. Further research led me to classify the dream of better as a sociotechnical imaginary, to use its framework to structure my research into examining better, and to review critical design and biodesign in this context. This process deepened my understanding of each project, of critical design and, ultimately, of better.
	
### Cycles of Practice and Reflection 	
![](images/cycles.png)

Ginsberg talks about cycles in her research between practice and reflection, or making and thinking—articulated in much thinking on art methods. An artist moves from one project to a period of reflection and writing, and then that thinking goes into the next work. This methodological approach, called "reflection-in-action," was described by Donald Schön in his 1986 book [*The Reflective Practitioner*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07377366.1986.10401080) (p. 130). It refers to a system structured by cycles of practice and reflection, where both successes and problems encountered through each artwork are reflected upon, placed into dialogue with relevant theory, and then fed into the direction of the next project. Schön (1986) describes this as spiralling through "stages of appreciation, action and reappreciation" (p. 131). 

### Artistic Strategies: Giving Language to What the Work Is Doing

When you look at the work of artists and designers, think about the strategies they use. What is the work/artist doing? Is the artist estranging, juxtaposing, speculating? 

Giving language to practice and the strategies being used is crucial for art as research. 

Here is an incomplete and non-exhaustive list of artistic strategies we've seen in the work examined so far:

- Visualizing, making visible (data, process, supply chains, [Anatomy of AI](https://anatomyof.ai/)) 
- Interactivity
- Storytelling/speculative fiction
- Intervention
- Performance (durational, lecture, etc.)
- Embodiment
- Participation
- Re-enactment
- Humor
- Toolmaking (software, browser extensions, kits)
- Experimental publishing/cataloguing ("[The field guide](https://placesjournal.org/article/cloud-and-field/)")
- Workshops
- Curating
- Reverse engineering
- Re-engineering 
- Attending to histories of tech, materials, art as practice
- Site specificity
- Data collection
- Web scraping
- Inversion (the gaze, surveillance, etc.)
- De-automation

## Research Methods Used by Artists

What does an artist do to research and develop work?  

- Literature review 
- Practice review
- Interviews
- Workshops
- Experiments in practice (material testing, learning to make media with a new app, writing software, materials experimentation)

Undertaking these kinds of activities is crucial for creating work that has traction, that contributes to a "grand conversation." 

![](images/golan.png)

To participate in conversations that run through fields—often over decades—two things are *essential*: deep awareness of your field of practice and public dissemination of your work. 

### Let's See This in Action: 

#### Golan Levin

Accompanied by [An Informal Catalogue of New-Media Performances Using Overhead Projectors (OHPs)](https://www.flong.com/archive/texts/lists/ohp/index.html).

Similarly, his [Index of Slit Scanning History](https://www.flong.com/archive/texts/lists/slit_scan/index.html) shows a deep engagement with a common creative coding technique that continues a conversation spanning the history of image making with cameras. 

#### Kyle McDonald

McDonald's grasp and positioning of his work in conversation with the field of facial recognition is clear in his essay, [Working with Faces](https://kcimc.medium.com/working-with-faces-e63a86391a93).

#### Mimi Onuoha
Mimi Onuoha's [Library of Missing Datasets](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets) emerges around a conversation happening in theory and research around data collection, surveillance, and representation in datasets. Speaking about face recognition, this is what Ruha Benjamin calls the "double bind": groups who are underrepresented in a dataset are subject to injustices like misrecognition, but subject to oppression or overpolicing if this gets corrected.
